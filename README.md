# Procedural-Spatial-Generation-2D-Unity-

This repository contains a Unity-based prototype focused on procedural spatial generation using Perlin noise and height maps. Algorithmic rules are used to generate spatial and terrain-like environments.

The core system uses noise-based functions to generate height values, which are then translated into a spatial map representation. 

Future extensions:

Additional noise layers and rules

Rule-based zoning or region differentiation

Combining procedural and authored inputs
