# Procedural-Spatial-Generation-2D-Unity-

This repository contains a Unity-based prototype focused on procedural spatial generation using Perlin noise and height maps. The project explores how simple algorithmic rules can be used to generate spatial and terrain-like environments.

The core system uses noise-based functions to generate height values, which are then translated into a spatial map representation. 

Future extensions:

Additional noise layers and rules

Rule-based zoning or region differentiation

Combining procedural and authored inputs

Although implemented in Unity using C#, the focus of the project is not gameplay, but procedural logic, system behavior, and spatial reasoning. The prototype serves as a foundation for experimenting with computational approaches to environment generation and can be adapted to different contexts where spatial variation and rule-based generation are relevant.
